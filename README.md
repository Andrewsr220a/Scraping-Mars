# Scraping-Mars

I scraped  created a web application that is able to scrape through multiple websites to retrieve information on mars.

1. One retrieved the latest headlines from https://redplanetscience.com/
2. The next retrieves images from https://spaceimages-mars.com/image/featured/mars2.jpg
3. Visited the following url https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/ and retrieves the facts table 
4. Lastly, visits the following https://marshemispheres.com/ and retrieves the images and several other items 

Bellow are screenshots of the app:
